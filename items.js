It&#39;s a grand total of 62 pages.\n\n\u2606 The pages are printed only on one side, so you don&#39;t have to worry about ink bleeding through and ruining the image on the other side. However, if you are using markers, use of another sheet of paper under the page you are working on to act as a blotter is recommended. Let&#39;s not go crazy. Use protection!\n\n\u2606 Beloved international customers: Holy moly, the USPS just raised the rates something fierce! :( My apologies - shipping is literally just this expensive. (This book is also on Amazon UK and EU...just sayin&#39;!)\n\n\u2606 If you are using markers, I recommend that you place a sheet of paper under the sheet you are coloring on to act as a blotter and absorb excess ink.\n\n\n\nOR PERHAPS YOU MIGHT LIKE:\n\n\u2606 Or perhaps you prefer a digital, instantly downloadable copy of this book:\nhttp:\/\/etsy.me\/22c6HSe\n\n\u2606 The pug coloring book that started it all, Flat Faced Friends:\nhttp:\/\/bit.ly\/pugcoloringbook\n\n\u2606 Or maybe, just maybe, you like pug art?\nhttp:\/\/etsy.me\/1RbexUB\n\n\nReturn to my main shop page here:\nhttp:\/\/ChickenpantsStudio.etsy.com\n\n\n\u263c \u263c \u263c Visit the Chickenpants blog for behind the scenes peeks!

than you see o your screen.\n\nCUSTOM AND PERSONALIZED ORDERS\nNo we do not offer proofs due to the amount of orders we receive per day and our turn around time is so fast (1-2 days), we do not have time to send proofs.\n\nWHOLESALE AVAILABILITY\nPlease message us for any questions you may have regarding wholesale.\nWe have sold our items in wholesale to vendors, boutique owners and store owners throughout the USA.","policy_seller_info":"","policy_updated_tsz":1453262741,"policy_has_private_receipt_info":false,"vacation_autoreply":"Sorry our shop is closed until we recover from this nasty flu!\r\nOpen orders are currently being processed. \r\nThanks for your understanding ","url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/shop\/SweetTeezLLC?utm_source=theironyardteaching&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","image_url_760x100":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/122\/0\/11960531\/iusb_760x100.20819963_km2e.jpg","num_favorers":1336,"languages":["en-US"],"upcoming_local_event_id":null,"icon_url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/105\/0\/11960531\/isla_fullxfull.17037608_bc1xva3n.jpg","is_using_structured_policies":true,"has_onboarded_structured_policies":true,"has_unstructured_policies":true,"custom_shops_state":0}},{"listing_id":272869390,"state":"active","user_id":82927793,"category_id":68891926,"title":"Vintage PUG Baseball Cap Low Profile Dad Hats Baseball Hat Embroidery Black","description":"Vintage PUG Baseball Cap Low Profile Dad Hats Baseball Hat Embroidery Black\n\n\u2737 Black\n\n\n\u2737 100% Cotton\n\n\n\u2737 One Size adjustable strap\n\n\n\u2737 Shipping from Long Beach, CA\n\n\n\u2737 If you have any questions or concerns please feel free to send us a message!","creation_tsz":1466640733,"ending_tsz":1477181533,"original_creation_tsz":1458339601,"last_modified_tsz":1466640733,"price":"17.99","currency_code":"USD","quantity":88,"tags":["pug","dog","boho","bohemian","grunge","hipster","tumblr hats","machine embroidery","embroidery","custom stitching","dad cap","dad hats","baseball hat"],"category_path":["Accessories","Hat"],"category_path_ids":[69150467,68891926],"materials":["cotton"],"shop_section_id":18654896,"featured_rank":null,"state_tsz":1465954837,"url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/listing\/272869390\/vintage-pug-baseball-cap-low-profile-dad?utm_source=theironyardteaching&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","views":2381,"num_favorers":481,"shipping_template_id":26631108837,"processing_min":1,"processing_max":2,"who_made":"i_did","is_supply":"false","when_made":"2010_2016","item_weight":"9","item_weight_units":null,"item_length":"8","item_width":"6","item_height":"6","item_dimensions_unit":"in","is_private":false,"recipient":null,"occasion":null,"style":null,"non_taxable":false,"is_customizable":false,"is_digital":false,"file_data":"","language":"en-US","has_variations":false,"taxonomy_id":26,"taxonomy_path":["Accessories","Hats & Caps","Baseball & Trucker Caps"],"used_manufacturer":false,"Images":[{"listing_image_id":942477154,"hex_code":"605E58","red":96,"green":94,"blue":88,"hue":45,"saturation":8,"brightness":37,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1458339602,"listing_id":272869390,"rank":1,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/118\/1\/12618578\/il_75x75.942477154_jgwv.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/118\/1\/12618578\/il_170x135.942477154_jgwv.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/118\/1\/12618578\/il_570xN.942477154_jgwv.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/118\/1\/12618578\/il_fullxfull.942477154_jgwv.jpg","full_height":1000,"full_width":1500},{"listing_image_id":989028677,"hex_code":"8B8A81","red":139,"green":138,"blue":129,"hue":54,"saturation":7,"brightness":54,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1458339602,"listing_id":272869390,"rank":2,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/119\/0\/12618578\/il_75x75.989028677_fjbb.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/119\/0\/12618578\/il_170x135.989028677_fjbb.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/119\/0\/12618578\/il_570xN.989028677_fjbb.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/119\/0\/12618578\/il_fullxfull.989028677_fjbb.jpg","full_height":452,"full_width":570}],"Shop":{"shop_id":12618578,"shop_name":"TheHatConnection","user_id":82927793,"creation_tsz":1456555974,"title":"Cutting Edge Headwear for the new generation!","announcement":"READ BELOW TO GET 15% OFF YOUR ORDER THROUGH PINTEREST!\n1.

I ordered ages ago - why haven&#39;t my items been dispatched yet?\r\nA. Snug Pug knitted items are hand made - often made to order. As I am a one woman enterprise and each hat can take me up to a day to make (I fit in my knitting when I can) there is often a 2 week waiting list that I am working through. This potentially means that your item will take me up to 2 weeks to make - plus shipping times. \r\n\r\n\r\nQ. I need my item for a special occasion - can I jump the queue?\r\nA. You can try! If you send me a message I will try to be accommodating if you need your item for a special occasion or by a certain date. \r\n\r\n\r\nQ. My item has been dispatched but it is taking a long time to reach me, is it lost?\r\nA. We&#39;re sorry your item is taking so long, as we ship from the UK items going overseas can take up to 20 days to reach you. All our knitted items to outside of the UK are tracked with recorded delivery so please check your tracking number. UK bound items are sent via second class signed for delivery\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. My tracking number is not working - does this mean it hasn&#39;t been sent?\r\nA. No, your item has been sent. I buy my tracking online from Royal Mail which provides a tracking number when I purchase - this is the number I send out to you in the &#39;your item has been dispatched&#39; email. Sometimes when the post office scans the label they attach a new tracking number. This means that your parcel now has a new shipping number and your original tracking number is invalid. If you find that your tracking number is not working I can check the receipt and find the new tracking number. \r\n\r\nQ. I bought a greeting card - why doesn&#39;t this have a tracking number?\r\nA. The greeting card range is sent non tracked this is to keep costs down for the buyer - tracking can be bought for an extra cost. \r\n\r\n\r\nQ. The item I received is not what I ordered.\r\nA. I&#39;m really sorry you have received the wrong item, please send me a message so I can arrange a replacement or a full refund. \r\n\r\n\r\nQ. My items are the wrong size, can I get a refund or swap?\r\nA. I&#39;m sorry your item did not fit correctly. Before buying please measure your pet as described in the listing (under &#39;How to Measure Your Pet&#39;). If you think I have sent you the wrong size please message me so I can investigate and rectify the matter. \r\n\r\n\r\nQ. There&#39;s nothing wrong with my order but I have changed my mind and no longer want it - can I get a refund or change my order?\r\nA. Yes, if your item(s) have not yet been shipped then I will offer a full refund or a swap to another item of equal value. If you think you ordered the wrong size and would like to size up - or would like to change to a more expensive design please  either message me, or cancel your original order and purchase the new item. If your item has already been shipped I will offer a full refund once I have received your item back. PLEASE NOTE you will have to pay for return shipping and I suggest you buy recorded delivery when returning items. Please contact me for a return address. \r\n\r\n\r\nQ. I&#39;d like to stock some of your items in my shop - is this possible?\r\nA. Thank you very much for thinking my items special enough! Please message me to discuss wholesale and buying stock etc. \r\n\r\nQ. I love my item and want to show the world how fantastic it is.\r\nA. Visit our Facebook or Instagram pages to show off your new purchase.
